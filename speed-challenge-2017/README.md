# Speed Challenge 2017

Accompanying write-up can be found on my [medium](https://medium.com/weightsandbiases/predicting-vehicle-speed-from-dashcam-video-f6158054f6fd) post.

**Objective**: Explore how well deep neural networks perform at predicting vehicle speed given just visual data (dashcam video) containing highway and suburban driving.  

**Built and tested on**:
operating system: Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS  
python version: 3.5.2  
pip version: 9.0.1
